### GROUP NAME HERE

Christopher Casino and Tanzeem Hasan

### Project Description:

The player attempts to guess the target word within six attempts. The program will return a modified version of the player's string. If a letter is correct and is in the right position, it will be unmodified. If a letter is correct and in the wrong position, it will be replaced with a ".". If a letter is incorrect it will be replaced with a "-". If the user guesses the word correctly, the game ends.

### Instructions:

How does the user install/compile/run the program.
First run "make compile". Then both players run "make init" to write a five letter word to a file for the other person to guess. Once both players have submitted their word, then both players will start playing.
